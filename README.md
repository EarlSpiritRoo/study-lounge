# study-lounge

A cozy live study room where each person appears as a tiny avatar.  

## What this project will eventually do
- Create a shared study room via URL  
- Show all live users as avatars  
- Streamers can embed the room as an overlay  
- Minimal UI, cozy aesthetic  

## Current state (MVP)
- Static mock room
- Fake users rendered on screen
- Simple layout and placeholder avatars  

## Tech
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Realtime backend (Supabase or Firebase) planned for later
